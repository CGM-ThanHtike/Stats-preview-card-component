## My process

- I'm pretty comfortable with this challenge. I analyze both the desktop and mobile design first. And, decided the best and simpliest approach to get the same design. And this is what I got.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned mix-blend-mode is pretty interesting. And, I used Utopia to calculate the variable title font size for responsive.
