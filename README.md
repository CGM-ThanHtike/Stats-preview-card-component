## My process

- I'm quite comfortable with this challenge. I first analyze both the desktop and mobile designs and then decide on the best and simplest approach to achieve the same design. Here is what I have come up with.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned mix-blend-mode is pretty interesting. And, I used Utopia to calculate the variable title font size for responsive.
